## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Because they are not written in machine-readable language, Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Python is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language. Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable. Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros
Large Community	
Flexible and Extensible	
Extensive Libraries	
Embeddable	

Cons :
Slower than compiled languages
Security
Work Environment
High memory consumption

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Machine learning / Artificial intelligence
Desktop GUI
Data analytics and data visualization 
Web development
Game development
Mobile app development
Embedded systems

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

int_var = 10
float_var = 18.25
string_var = 'ineuron batch2' # or another way "ineuron batch2"
bool_var = True # if we want to assign false then it should be like False

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans : String

Q8. What is type casting?

Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

# int() , float(), str(), bool()
int_var = int_var + 10  # int_var = 10 + 10 and in next step int_var = 20
casted_int_var = float(int_var)
casted_float_var = int(float_var)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

name = input("Enter value for name = ")
age = int(input("Enter value for age = "))

Q10. What are keywords?

Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

The list of keywords is : 

[‘False’, ‘None’, ‘True’, ‘and’, ‘as’, ‘assert’, ‘async’, ‘await’, ‘break’, ‘class’, ‘continue’, ‘def’, ‘del’, ‘elif’, ‘else’, ‘except’, ‘finally’, ‘for’, ‘from’, ‘global’, ‘if’, ‘import’, ‘in’, ‘is’, ‘lambda’, ‘nonlocal’, ‘not’, ‘or’, ‘pass’, ‘raise’, ‘return’, ‘try’, ‘while’, ‘with’, ‘yield’]



Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

We can not do that.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
  print()
Q14. What are operators in Python?

In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands. Here is an example: >>> >>> a = 10 >>> b = 20 >>> a + b 30. In this case, the + operator adds the operands a and b together.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

// => floor division

x = 15
y = 2

print(15 // 2)

output : 7

/ => division

x = 15
y = 2

print(15 /2)

Output : 7.5

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Ans : 
x = "iNeuron"* 4
print(x)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

chk_even_odd_num = int(input("Enter Number: "))

x = chk_even_odd_num % 2

if x==0:
    print(chk_even_odd_num,"is Even Number")
else:
    print(chk_even_odd_num,"is Odd Number")    

Q18. What are boolean operator?

The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false. Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Ans : True and False and True


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

if… elif…else are conditional statements that provide you with the decision making that is required when you want to execute code based on a particular condition. The if… elif…else statement used in Python helps automate that decision making process.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age = int(input("Enter Age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I cant't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

num1 = 12
num2 = 75
num3 = 150
num4 = 180
num5 = 145
num6 = 525
num7 = 50

#code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.


e1 = num1 % 2
e2 = num2 % 2
e3 = num3 % 2
e4 = num4 % 2
e5 = num5 % 2
e6 = num6 % 2
e7 = num7 % 2

x=0
if e1 == 0:
    print(num1, "is divisible by Number 2")

if e2 == 0:

    print(num2,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num2
if e3 == 0:
    print(num3,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num3
if e4 == 0:
    print(num4,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num4
if e5 == 0:
    print(num5,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num5
if e6 == 0:
    print(num6,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num6
if e7 == 0:
    print(num7,"is divisible by Number 2")
    x=x+num7
    
print(x,"total even number") 


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

num1 = 12
num2 = 75
num3 = 150
num4 = 180
num5 = 145
num6 = 525
num7 = 50

#The number must be divisible by five


e1 = num1 % 5
e2 = num2 % 5
e3 = num3 % 5
e4 = num4 % 5
e5 = num5 % 5
e6 = num6 % 5
e7 = num7 % 5


if e1 == 0:
    print(num1, "is divisible by Number 5")
else :
    if e2 == 0:
        print(num2,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    if e3 == 0:
        print(num3,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    if e4 == 0:
        print(num4,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    if e5 == 0:
        print(num5,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    if e6 == 0:
        print(num6,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    if e7 == 0:
        print(num7,"is divisible by Number 5")
        
    
       


# If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
# If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

x = 600

if x>=150 and x>500:
    print("BYE")
